Fixedformat4j

  Fixedformat4j is an easy to use Java framework for working with fixed formatted text files. By annotating
  your code you can setup the offsets and format as for your data when reading/writing to and from fixed format files.

  Fixedformat4j handles the following build in datatypes:

  * String

  * Character

  * Long

  * Integer

  * Double

  * Float

  * Date

  * Boolean

  * BigDecmial

  At the same time it is straight forward to write and plugin your own formatters for custom datatypes.

* Getting started

  To start using Fixedformat4j you only have to annotate your getter methods and use the FixedFormatManager to load and
  export your fixedformat text according to your annotation instructions.

  A sample can be seen here:

%{code-snippet|id=basicrecord|code=java|file=../samples/src/main/java/com/ancientprogramming/fixedformat4j/samples/basic/BasicRecord.java}

  This annotated class can now be loaded and exported using a FixedFormatManager

%{code-snippet|id=basicusage|code=java|file=../samples/src/main/java/com/ancientprogramming/fixedformat4j/samples/basic/BasicUsage.java}

  Running this simple program will generate the following output.

  Note that the integer changed value in the exported string.

+--
The parsed string: string
The parsed integer: 123
The parsed date: Thu May 29 00:00:00 CEST 2008
Exported: string    001002008-05-29
